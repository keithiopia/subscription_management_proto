## Email Team Prototype

This is a prototype of a email subscription management interface. We plan to do
user research into this for Q3.

Deployed at: [https://email-team-prototype.herokuapp.com/manage](https://email-team-prototype.herokuapp.com/manage)

Speak to [@tuzz](http://github.com/tuzz) if you need access to deploy.

## Setup

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/manage](http://localhost:3000/manage)

## Next steps

- Host the files from the previous prototype in this app
- Add a link to the verification page of the old prototype
- The link should look [like this](http://localhost:3000/create?title=Example%20subscription&url=http://example.com&frequency=weekly&address=foo@bar.com)
- Make the unsubscribe/undo functionality change session data
